# solarized-light theme
#
# This file is in TOML format, see https://toml.io/en/ for more information.
#
# A theme consists of scopes and a style for each scope.
#
# In this example:
#
#   [tm.help]
#   section = "gold1"
#
# "tm.help.section" is a theme scope, and "gold1" is the style. The TOML file
# format allows you to specify a theme scope using several different
# syntaxes. This syntax yields the same result:
#
#   tm.help.section = "gold1"
#
# All theme scopes are present in this file, but set to "default".
# The theme scopes are all present to make it easy for you to
# customize them. "default" means to apply no color or styling, making this
# theme template the visual equivilent of no theme.
#
# You can set a style for each theme scope. A style can specify colors
# and attributes (like bold or italic). Ancient terminals are monochrome,
# really old terminals could display 16 colors, old terminals can display
# 256 colors, most modern terminals can display 16.7 million colors.
#
# Specify a color using any of the following:
#
#   #8700af           CSS-style hex notation
#   rgb(135,0,175)    RGB form using three integers
#   dark_magenta      color names
#   color(91)         color numbers
#
# Color names and numbers are shown at
# https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/appendix/colors.html
#
# All of the above forms produce the exact same color.
#
# By itself, a color will set the foreground color. To set the background
# color, preceed the color with the word "on".
#
#   white on rgb(135,0,75)
#   #ffffff on dark_magenta
#
# Specify additional text attributes by adding additional words to the style:
#
#   #ffffff on #8700af bold strike
#   color(91) underline
#
# The most useful text attributes are:
#
#   bold        bold text
#   italic      italic text (not supported on Windows)
#   strike      text with a strikethrough line
#   underline   underlined text
